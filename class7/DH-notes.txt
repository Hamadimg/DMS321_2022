Setting up your dreamhost account for nodeJS

[NOTE: in all examples, replace "mydomain.xyz" by your site's actual domain name.  Replace "myusername" by your account name, which should be "dh_" followed by some random characters.]

1. ssh - log in via the command-line
2. install nvm
3. install node
4. put static files in mydomain.xyz/public
5. create mydomain.xyz/.htaccess for Passenger
6. create mydomain.xyz/app.js
7. restart passenger


Details:

1. ssh

  On a Mac:
     Open the application "Terminal".
     Type the command
               ssh myusername@mydomainname.xyz
     The first time you do this, it will give you a message about "the authenticity of ... can't be established".  Type "yes" at the prompt.
     Enter your password (I emailed it to you).
     
  On Windows:
     Install the application "putty", from https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
     Run putty and connect to mydomain.xyz
     The first time you do this, it ask if you want to save a "key fingerprint" for the site.  Say yes.
     Enter your password (I emailed it to you).
     
  On Linux:
     Open a shell window.
     Follow the rest of the Mac instructions.
 
 
  Aside: if you want to change your password, type the command "passwd" and follow the prompts.
  
  

2 & 3. Install nvm (the Node Version Manager) and node

  See https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217185397-Node-js-overview for official instructions on using nodejs on a Dreamhost VPS.
  
  https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029083351-Installing-a-custom-version-of-NVM-and-Node-js has the complete instructions for installing nvm & node.
  The important details are (all this is done in the ssh session started in step 1):
  
    Run the commands
       curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
       source .bashrc
       nvm install v13.14.0
       
       
  Aside: the bash shell annoys the hell out of me for not running the .bashrc in login shells (I'm an old csh user).  Personally, I recommend doing the following because of that:
       echo "source .bashrc" >> ~/.bash_profile

  4. Put static files in "public" folder
  
    This can be done using the WebFTP link that I sent you.  Note that if you change your password, the link will no longer work automatically, but you can still log in using your website name, username and password.
